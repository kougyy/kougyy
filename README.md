- (￣▽￣)ノ Hi, I'm @kougyy, hope you enjoy my github 
- (￣^￣)ゞ I'm interested in the development of highly specialized programs, as well as sites. While I am just starting out, I want to develop as efficiently as possible. 
- ଘ(੭ˊ꒳ˋ)੭✧ I'm currently taking a python course on the stepik
- (╯✧▽✧)╯ I want to cooperate with the same developers of sites and programs to help each other and develop together
